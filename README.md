# TapTitans Optimiser
An android app version of Yatto.me, capable of pulling data from the tap titans save file directly

# Current features
 - Read direct from gamesave
 - Stats
  - Shows info about the save file selected
 - Relic Optimiser
  - Different optimisation methods
  - Calculated values displayed
 - Sequencer
  - Current sequence
  - Simulate salvages
  - Weapon sequence (?)

# Planned:
 - Save editing
  - Clone save
  - Edit save (not save from game file)
  - Persist saves between sessions
  - Write save to file (maybe? I have concerns over this app being used as a modding tool)
  
 - Floating "Chat heads"
  - Sample code found here: http://androidsrc.net/facebook-chat-like-floating-chat-heads/
